# Nucleus
## "AI with superpowers"
 Only the "Default system AI" has superpowers.
 Comes with 20 custom characters, but you also use the Custom (13) character to make your own. Type "!admin" in the custom character to create more advanced specifications, which was created to have you be able to make your own character and save them. DOESN'T WORK RIGHT NOW!
 
 Also btw "*n-client.exe*" is literally just a conhost.exe but I used Resource Hacker so I can get another logo ðŸ˜Ž. 

 Warning : Doesn't work on POSIX or any other systems besides Windows. If you're on Linux or Mac, adding in scripts for your OS would be appreciated! :D

# Launch
Alright, now time to launch :

1. In "API-KEY.txt", enter your OpenAI api key.

2. Inside the project root directory, run "python *ai.py* --pip-install-requirements" and use "pip install -r *requirements.txt*".

3. **Run *main.py***
